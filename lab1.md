## Reports on cd
  When I ran the "cd" command at the beginning, nothing happened becasue there were no arguments. Once I put an argument in the command line with "cd," the terminal gave me access to the folders within the directory. I opened the final directory to access files, which gave me an error when using "cd" to access a file becasue files are not directories. 
     
## Reports on ls 
  Using the command with no arguments, the "ls" command displays the folders within the workspace, which in this case is lecture1. Using "ls" with an argument would display the files and folders within the argument. To continue accessing the folders I would need to use the command "cd." Using "ls" with a file as an argument would create a minor error, displaying the name of the file NOT the contents.

## Reports on cat
  When using the command "cat" with no arguments, the terminal returns essentially nothing with a space to type any characters. When using "cat" with an argument that is a directory, the terminal will simply state that the argument is a directory. When using a path to a file as an argument, the terminal will return the contents of the file. For the context of the lab, using "cat" on a text file returned the text within the file.
