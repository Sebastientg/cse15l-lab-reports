# Lab Report 2

## Part 1
In the code above the method called is the "handleRequest" method. This method takes in a url as an arugment to disect it. The code checks conditons on the query of the url to determine what messges should be added to the server. There are two important values belonging to the class. "displayOfWords" is a string that accumulates the lines of the numbered messages being added to the url. The end of the url changes when I add different messages. "count" is an integer value that updates to keep track of the number of messages. This value is casted into a string to be displayed as well (when added to the main string). For testing purposes, I also created a condition to reset the values. If the path in the url is "/reset," the list of messages in the string varibale will be reset to an empty string and the count of messges will be reset to zero.

Here is the code:

## Part 3
Something I learned in week 1 and 2 that I found super cool was learning how to work with urls. I learned how to use java libraries and imported functionalities to start and manipulate web servers with basic code. This also helped me become more familiar with the commands in the command line for starting servers and understanding the directories I am working in.
